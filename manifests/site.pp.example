# interface is functional with the assumption that:
#   a) The public_interface will have an IP address reachable by
#      all other nodes in the openstack cluster.  This address will
#      be used for API Access, for the Horizon UI, and as an endpoint
#      for the default GRE tunnel mechanism used in the OVS network
#      configuration.
#   b) The external_interface is used to provide a Layer2 path for 
#      the l3_agent external router interface.  It is expected that
#      this interface be attached to an upstream device that provides
#      a L3 router interface, with the default router configuration
#      assuming that the first non "network" address in the external 
#      network IP subnet will be used as the default forwarding path
#      if no more specific host routes are added.
