create_sitepp.py


   Usability
   ---------
        create_sitepp.py
        create_sitepp.py -f <site_data.txt>

  Functionality
  -------------
  This script creates the site.pp manifest file by prompting
  user for all the required information
 

  Prerequisites
  -------------
  1. You should have root access to make sure this script completes 
     successfully
  2. Collect all the information and have it handy before running the script


  Information
  -----------
      Script prompts the user for various COI configuration information
   and creates site.pp file and places it in /etc/puppet/manifests 
   directory.

      If a site.pp file already exists in /etc/puppet/manifests directory, 
   user is prompted and if agreed the existing site.pp is saved in 
   /home/n1kv/logs directory. Upto 10 site.pp files are saved. 
   Named site.pp.1, site.pp.2 ..

      All the data entered by the user is also saved in a data file in 
   /home/logs/n1kv directory named site_data_file.txt. If the user
   exits the script halfway and doesn't want to enter all the information
   again, the -f option can be used. Script will then read from the data file
   and prompt the user if they want to accept those values.

   Upto 20 data files are backed up at /home/n1kv/logs. User can check 
   the contents and use the appropriate data file.
     Also after all the data is entered the user can save the data file
   and user it for later runs.
